## Ingredients
- 250g [[Flour]]
- 4 [[Egg]]
- 500ml (adviced cold) [[Milk]] (I don't advice non dairy milk with this recipe)
- 1 pinch of [[Salt]]
- 2 big spoon of [[Sugar]]
- 50g (melted) [[Butter]] + a chunk of non melted one (get it outside before so it's soft)
### Optional
- 2 big spoon of [[Rhum]]
- a few drop of extract of [[Vanilla]]

----
## Instructions
### The Dough
- Add the [[Flour]] in a bowl, with the [[Salt]] and the [[Sugar]]
- Add the [[Egg]] in the center
	- Mix slowly
- When it starts to be mixed, add the [[Milk]] bit by bit
- Add the melted [[Butter]] and mix well

### Crepes
- Use a flat pan, on medium heat. 
- Use a sheet of paper, take a bit of the chunk of butter, and apply it on the pan so it's slighly oily
- With a laddle, add some dough in the pan, and rotate the pan so that there's dough everywhere in equal proportion.
- When the crepes start to turn orange/brown, turn it (either with a spatulla, or by flipping it)
- Let it some time on the other side, like 1 minute
- Repeat until the end of the dough
