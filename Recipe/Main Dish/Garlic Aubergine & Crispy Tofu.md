## Ingredients
- 2 medium Chinese [[Aubergine]] (or 1 normal [[Aubergine]])
- 1 block of extra firm [[Tofu]]
- 3 [[Scallion]]
- 4 cloves of [[Garlic]]
- 70ml [[Cornstarch]]
- [[Oil]]

### Sauce
- 30ml [[Soy Sauce]]
- 30ml [[Oyster sauce]]
- 15ml dark [[Soy Sauce]]
- 7ml black [[Vinegar]]
- 7ml [[Ginger]] grated (or [[Ginger]] paste)
- 7ml brown [[Sugar]]

## Instructions
1. Gently press the [[Tofu]] with paper towels to remove excess moisture. If desired, press the [[Tofu]] in a tofu press or place between paper towels under a heavy object for a few minutes to remove even more moisture. Cut the tofu into 2cm cubes. Dust the [[Tofu]] with about 30ml of [[Cornstarch]] and toss to fully coat.
2. Remove the tops from the Chinese [[Aubergine]] then quarter them longwise (creating 4 long strips per [[Aubergine]]). Cut the strips into 1.5cm pieces to create many small chunks. Dust the eggplant with about 30ml of [[Cornstarch]] and toss to fully coat. (If using regular [[Aubergine]] cube into 2cm inch pieces)
3. Combine all of the sauce ingredients and set aside.
4. Heat a swirl of veggie [[Oil]] over medium-high heat in a wok or large skillet. Add the [[Aubergine]] chunks and cook, stirring occasionally, until the [[Aubergine]] is crispy in some places and soft all the way through, about 5-7 minutes. Try to position the [[Aubergine]] so the cut sides are in contact with the pan. The [[Aubergine]] will likely absorb the oil, but thereâ€™s no need to keep adding more. Once cooked, remove to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.
5. To the skillet, add another generous swirl of veggie oil. Once warm, add the cubed [[Tofu]] pieces. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the [[Tofu]] is golden and crispy on most sides, about 10 minutes. Once cooked, remove to a plate. Note, using a spatula to flip the pieces is much easier than using tongs.
6. Add a little more oil to the skillet, once warm add the [[Garlic]] and the whites of the [[Scallion]]. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the sauce and mix everything together, then add the [[Tofu]] and [[Aubergine]] back to the skillet. Remove from heat and mix everything together. Top with the [[Scallion]] greens, serve immediately with white rice.
